<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Joysheel, an enthusiastic learner and passionate coder. I’m currently focused on web development and am always eager to dive deeper into new technologies. My goal is to create impactful, user-friendly websites and expand my skills across various disciplines like coding, video editing, and language learning.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me working out, exploring new skills, or diving into mindset books to improve myself continuously. This project is a part of my journey to master web development and challenge myself to keep learning every day.</p>
